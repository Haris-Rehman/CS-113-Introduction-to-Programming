Task 1:
Write a program which takes an integer input from the user (max value can be 8). The program then creates a matrix which displays the power of the input integer which is incremented in each column and subsequent row. For example, if a user enters the value 5.

Task 2:
Write a program which moves the character ‘X’ in a 5x5 Matrix at the output. The input to this program is a character from the user: ‘w’, ‘a’, ‘s’ and ‘d’, in order to move ‘X’ up, left, down, and right. If user enters ‘0’, then the program should exit. Make sure that the character ‘X’ is not able to move outside the limits.
